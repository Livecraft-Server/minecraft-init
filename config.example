# Settings file for minecraft-init
# ==================================
# 
# Make a copy of this file named config
# and edit the variables to your needs.
#

# Name of vanilla server jar
MC_JAR="minecraft_server.jar"

# Name of Bukkit/Spigot jar
SP_JAR="spigot.jar"

# Revision of Minecraft to use. Can be a version number (1.8.7) or "latest".
MC_REV="latest"

# Name of server.jar to use ($MC_JAR for vanilla or $SP_JAR for Bukkit/Spigot.)
SERVICE=$SP_JAR

# Name to use for the screen instance
SCREEN="minecraft"

# User that should run the server
USERNAME="minecraft"

# Path to minecraft server directory 
MCPATH="/home/${USERNAME}/minecraft"

# Path to BuildTools directory
BTPATH="${MCPATH}/BuildTools"

# Command to use for broadcast
BROADCAST_COMMAND="say"

# Number of CPUs/cores to use
CPU_COUNT=2

# Initial memory usage
INITMEM="512M"

# Maximum amount of memory to use
# Remember: give the ramdisk enough space, subtract from the total amount
# of RAM available the size of your map and the RAM-consumption of your base system.
MAXMEM="2048M"

# Whether to output commands for the plugin ConsoleLikeChat ($1 is the command to run)
FORMAT='$1'

# Settings for backups
# ==================================

# Where the whole minecraft directory is copied when the backup is executed
# The backup is a complete, uncompressed backup of the entire server folder.
WHOLEBACKUP="/home/${USERNAME}/mcbackup/server"

# Format for world backup (tar or zip).
BACKUPFORMAT="tar" 

# Normally backups will be put in a subfolder to $BACKUPPATH with todays date
# and the backups themselves will have a timestamp.

# But if BACKUPSCRIPTCOMPATIBLE is set the world backups will be put directly
# in $BACKUPPATH without timestamp to be compatible with
# [backup rotation script](https://github.com/adamfeuer/rotate-backups)
#
BACKUPSCRIPTCOMPATIBLE=YES

# Compress the whole backup with bzip2?
# Note that this may not save a lot of disk space since there can be a lot of files
# in your server directory, that are already compressed, but it can slow down the
# backup a bit. This highly depends on the plugins you're using.
#
# For example: The png files generated by Dynmap are already compressed and still use
# a lot of space in your server directory, so the compression ratio of the compressed
# backup will not be very high.
COMPRESS_WHOLEBACKUP=YES

# Things to leave alone ;)
